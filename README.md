# Stanford-Machine-Learning-Ng

This is an online course diving into the fundamentals of Machine Learning. 

The problem sets are designed for Octave or Matlab.  I'm using Octave as it's a nimble program good for prototyping.

While it's geared to be accessible, I'd find it much more difficult without a working understanding of linear algebra and multivariable calculus, 
particularly matrix multiplication and partial derivatives. 

Here is are brief descriptions of the problem sets:

PS4: Computing backpropagation to predict handwritten number recognition
  Training data results: 96.3% accuracy on 5000 examples
  (could by improved to near 100% with tweaks to lambda regularization and increasing the number of iterations)

PS3: Multi-class logistic regression and forward propagation to predict handwritten number recognition, 1 hidden layer
  Training data results: 94.9% accuracy on 5000 examples
  
PS2: Logistic regression to predict university acceptance based on two exam scores
  Incl. gradient descent and regularization
  
PS1: Linear regression to predict new business profitability as a function of city population
  Incl. gradient descent
